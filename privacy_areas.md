The unpacking/privacy areas were first introduced shortly after we opened in 2009, serving as experimental fast-return areas where people could open boxes and not clutter the sandbox with junk for hours. 

To our surprise the experiment seemed to work, and following the addition of parcel privacy the areas have become more like public dressing rooms, used by people today as a place to change their clothes without others nearby watching.

**The privacy areas change color based on their status.**

- ![#0000ff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0000ff/000000?text=+) Vacant and available</p>
- ![#ff0000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff0000/000000?text=+) Currently occupied</p>

_Please note that these areas are covered by our sandbox rules. Anybody found to be misusing them in any way may face a temporary ban._
